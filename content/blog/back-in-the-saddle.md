So as things generally go with me and any kind of bloggy-ish site, this one has gone stale as I try to figure out just exactly what I want to do with it. Generally, in the best of worlds, I would use it as I track my progress through the world of javascript. It's something that I've wanted to pick up for some time and just have never had the time to do so. Well, now I've gone through at least one Udemy course for beginning javascript, and now I've decided to go ahead and jump on into the deep end and have started an Angular 8 course. 

I figure if it's good enough for Google (who own my soul, of course) that it's good enough for me. At least I don't have to worry about moving from AngularJS to Angular 2+.

I'd also like to use this as a way to keep track of my weight loss journey. Keto has been more than an excellent choice, and as I have past the 80 pounds gone mile marker I am well on my way to where I want to be. It's been nice to be able to look in the mirror and not dislike what I see.

Hopefully I don't let this sit for another few months before the next update.

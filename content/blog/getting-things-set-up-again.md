# Here we go again!

I've decided to go ahead and give this blogging thing another go. There was, at one point in my life, where I had something of an ambition to become a writer. I had all kinds of grandiose ideas to create some amazing science fiction fantasy world, even nearly filling a single subject binder full of some cool, interesting (to me, anyhow) space faring tale. It was probably going to win the next big award. Probably.

Not really though. Life takes its strange twists and turns, and I fully believe that you wind up right where you were meant to be. For me, that is working in a technical field and constantly trying to better myself and my skills. But, does that mean that I have to give up writing? Heck no. Over the past few years, I have written for online websites (mostly Android related, and mostly game related at that) though it has been a few years since I've done that. So I figure that it's time to dust the cobwebs off - both my writing and my head.

If one can do the proverbial two birds with one stone, then that's all fine by me. I have been meaning to pick up some Javascript, so when one of the more popular courses on Udemy was included in a recent sale (of which, they have them *all the time*) I figured "why not". At the time, I was also looking at creating a static pages blog with [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), so here we are. Might as well combine the two and I can use this to track some progress. Eventually, I would like to get to where I can write more about my journey and, who knows, maybe even teach somebody something.
